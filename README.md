# AI Tab Organizer

AI Tab Organizer turns every chaotic browsing session into a tidy command center. Instant Quick Organize groups untagged tabs by battle-tested URL heuristics, while Chrome AI Organize harnesses Google‚Äôs built-in Prompt API for private, on-device intelligence that never leaves the browser. When you connect your Gemini API key, Online AI Organize upgrades the experience with cloud analysis that understands titles and URLs, reconciles inconsistent labels, and keeps related tabs together. A dedicated Ungroup action resets everything in one click, making it easy to retry different strategies without hunting through Chrome menus.

Localization is first-class: the popup, settings page, and status feedback instantly follow your chosen language, or automatically mirror the browser UI when you prefer the default. Chrome‚Äôs Translator API converts finished group titles so every collection stays meaningful to multilingual teams. Category dictionaries cover eight major languages out of the box, giving predictable translations even when offline or before models finish downloading. Theme-aware icons switch between light and dark artwork automatically, keeping the toolbar consistent with your operating system.

Power users will appreciate the streamlined settings panel. From there you manage the Gemini key, review the current Gemini 2.5 flash preview model reference, jump to Google‚Äôs documentation for securing keys, and learn how to enable the built-in Chrome AI stack on eligible devices. Because every grouping flow skips tabs you have already arranged, no existing Chrome tab groups are disturbed unless you explicitly hit Ungroup, making experimentation safe during focus-intensive work. Whether you are triaging research, comparing purchase options, prepping lessons, or switching between client projects, the extension keeps context within reach and dramatically cuts the time spent digging through dozens of forgotten tabs. Install AI Tab Organizer today, reclaim your focus, and let your browser feel fast, smart, and effortless again.
